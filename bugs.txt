The rotation of blaster placement gets a bit wonky when you factor in the corners of a square in ShapeBuilder.

Blaster placement can overlap. Don't want that! But when trying to get out of a blasterPlacement Area2D into a goodPlacementArea it still shows up as red! _on_Placement_area_exited in Blaster.gd is likely the culprit

QoL features:
	have the blaster stop following the mouse inside of the badArea. Could be done with signals from badArea
